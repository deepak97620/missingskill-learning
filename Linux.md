
### History of Linux ###

- Unix system was created in Bell lab using ‘C’ Language and it was released after one year in 1970 . 
- Firstly It was too costly because of paid service.
- Then some researcher from university and some Ex. Employee of Bell lab started creating new system using Unix and both of them created BSD(Berkeley Software Distribution) and this was cheap than Unix O.S.
- Richard Stallman was researcher with the help of few office friend he started to make free software that will be free to use why because the Unix O.S. was too costly.
- In 1985 Free operating system was created but it had less adoption due to less feature in O.S. or may be something else.
- Linus was researcher and he was doing research on maths and physics he used BSD Operating system but he don’t liked so much so Linus make his own kernel using C language, Kernal is software which interact with hardware 
- Around 1991 Richard Stallman and Linus created Operating system that is GNU /LINUX and now it is free to use.
- So now we can say that **Richard Stallman** and **Linus** both are the Father of  Free software.

----------
	
**GNU  :**  	It allows different-different software

**LINUX :** 	It is a Kernal 

**GNU / LINUX:**  It is a Operating system


### Linux ###

- Linux is Kernal.
- Kernal is heart and core of an Operating system
- Kernal is software which interact with hardware 

### Functions of Kernel ###

- Memory Management 
- Device Management 

### Why Linux in 2021 ###

- It is Reliable.
- It is Private we can say secure.
- Linux is active since 1991 till now. This Operating system is using by over 95% of the world technology.
- Linux is regulary updates so that system can be updated without rebooting it.
- Operating system means communication between software and hardware
- Android is one of the most popular platforms on the planet, It has a Linux operating system.
- Unix and linux are upto 80% same.
- **Eg  :**  Windows  and Mac OS, GNU /LINUX is an operating system.


### Distributions of linux ###
There are lots of Linux distributors and those are provide different-different features some are

- Dos/Window
- GNU/Linux
- Ubuntu
- RedHat
- Mint
- Unix
- Apple/Unix
- FreeBSD
- NetBSD and Many more.


### Linux  Commands ###

- **cd ..**     		This is used for go to the one step back from current step.
- **cd ../:**			It will go to another folder.


----------

- **ls –t :**  display the files in ascending order i.e., the latest one coming on top and old files is on the bottom.
- **ls –F :**  To check the  folder or directory.
- **ls –l –h –t –r –F or ls –lhtrF:** display all above result in single command 
- **ls –help :**      It display the all commands of flag .

### Linux File system ###

Linux has a structure like a tree.
 
A Linux file system is a collection of files and folders

- **boot :**	System kernel is stored 
-  **etc  :** 	Contains System Configuration files  
- **home  :** 	User data is stored 
-  **var  :** 	Variable file store
- **tmp  :** 	used for temporary configuration is stored  
- **bin  :**		binary files are stored 
- **sbin  :** 	System binary is stored
- **usr  :** 	User system resource   
- **root  :** 	Home directory for the root user  
- **lib  :** 		System Libraries are stored   
- **dev  :** 	hardware device attached to the system 
- **prac :**	show current system info
- **mnt  or media :**	external drive attachment purpose
