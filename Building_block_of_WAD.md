### Basic Building Blocks of Web Application Development ### 

**IP Address** 

- IP Address stands for Internet Protocol Address. 
- It is Unique address Assigned to each device and it is in numeric format for identification of system.
- It allows other devices to identify and connect to the device using  IP address.
- It is must for application,  also It helps the device to connect to other devices.
- Every application has its own unique IP address.

**Types**

1. **IPv4**         
	- It  is a 32-bit IP address.
	- It is mostly use by  in networking than IPv6.<br>
                
2. **Ipv6**       
	- It is a 128-bit IP address.
	- It have less number of  use  in networking than IPv4.

**Also we have**
 
- **Public IP:**	 It has same IP of all connected device
- **Private IP:**	 It has unique IP of each device
- **Static:**	 It is uses by the server


**Port** 

- It is an  entry point of  accesing  any application.
- It means sender and receiver both can identify each one and then to connect with each other.
- Port and IP,  mixture of  both is much important for running any application

**There are  65535 number of  port**

- (0 – 1023) 		reserved port by systems
- (1024 – 49150) 	Application ports
- (49151 – 65635) 	open ports we can use this port
- It has web port 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS,
- HTTPS,  where ‘s’ stands for secure so it is secure than HTTP


### Domain ###

- Domain names can be easily read by human so that’s why domain name are use  **i.e.**  easy to remember
- Domain name is equal to IP address.<br>
  **Eg.** samal.in,  google.com etc.
- ICANN provide and manage domain address
  Types
- Global Domain
- Country level Domain


### Web server  ###
- It is like computer, it has software and hardware that accepts request via HTTP<br>
 **Eg.** Apache 2.0, Nginx, Lighthttpd  etc.


### HTTP Verbs ###
- **HTTP:** stands for  Hiper Text Tranfer Protocol. 
- **GET:** 	It is used for fetching the data from server
- **POST:**  	It is used for sending data to the server 
- **DELETE:** 	can be used for  query like delete anything
- **OPTION:** 	can be used for  query like communication. 
- **PUT:**  	PUT is also used to send the data to server,  also  It can be used for update the resource
- **HEAD:** 	can be used for  query like request and response of headers from server


### HTTP Ports ###
- **1xx**<br>
	Not used<br>
	Reserved

- **2xx:** 	It gives All successful response from server<br>
	**Eg.** 200,201,202………

- **3xx:**	 It gives redirection or migration detail from one location to other location<br>
	**Eg.** 300,301,302………	

- **4xx:**	It is user specific call,  means something went wrong from user side<br>
	**Eg.** 400,401,402………

- **5xx:** 	It can be happen when there is server issue<br>
	**Eg.** 500,501,502………



### Software License ###
- It is contract between supplies and buyer of an application,
- where licencee allows user to distribute, modify etc of  in software.
- It Iis like provides a legal way of use any software.<br>
**Eg.**   BSD<br>
Apache 2.0<br>
GPL<br>
MIT<br>
Mozilla and many more.


### Database ###
- Database can be used for storing and manipulation of data. Data can be in any form.
- We have  two type of databse management system.

**Relational Database management system**
 
- It store data in relational format.
- It is secured than Non-relational database
- It is suitable for structured data
- It is not easy for programmer compare to non-relational database<br>
**Eg.** MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL  etc.

**Non-Relational Database management system**

- It store data in random format.
- It is not secured than Relational database
- It is suitable for Unstructured data
- It is easy for programmer compare to Relational database<br>
**Eg.** MongoB,  Redis,  Cassendra, NeoJS etc.

### Cloud providers ###

It is way to access computing services.<br>
**Eg.**<br>
- AWS (Amazon web service)<br>
- Google Cloud<br>
- Azure by Microsoft<br>
- Bluemix by IBM<br>
- Digital otion<br>
- Vultr  etc.

### Cloud provider also we can say ###

- **IAAS:**	Infrastructure-as-a-service
- **PAAS:** 	Paas Platform-as-a-Service 


### JIRA - Project Management Tool ###

- Google sheet
- DOC
- Asana  etc.


### Infrastructure ###
**Stages of infrastructure**

**1st** Dev (development)<br>
**2nd** UAT/Staging<br>
**3rd.** Production System
 

### Code Repository ###
- contribution of source code can be manage here
- GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket etc.


### Git Development Workflow ###
**Stages of Git Development Workflow for any website**

**1st** Feature Branch <br>
**2nd** Develop Branch <br>
**3rd** Stage Branch<br>
**4th** Master Branch(Deployed to production)
